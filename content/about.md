title: 'About DAO Horizons'
---

DAO Horizons is the research publication arm of Lokapal, dedicated to exploring decentralized governance (DeGov), DAO structures, and the philosophical and systemic foundations of decentralization. Through rigorous analysis and interdisciplinary insights, DAO Horizons aims to bridge theory and practice in the evolving world of DAOs.

## Our Focus
DAO Horizons leans heavily into system theory and philosophy to examine how decentralized governance can be effectively structured, sustained, and evolved. Our research delves into:
- Governance models and their systemic implications.
- The philosophical underpinnings of decentralization and autonomy.
- Emerging trends and innovations in DAO mechanisms.
- Practical case studies on successful and failed DAOs.

## Bridging Research and Practice
At DAO Horizons, we believe that research should not exist in isolation but should inform and shape real-world DAO implementations. Our work is designed to provide actionable insights for DAO builders, researchers, and governance theorists alike.

## Stay Connected
All DAO Horizons articles are also available on our Substack for those who prefer a newsletter format.
