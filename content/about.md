title: 'About DAO Horizons'
---

DAO Horizons is the research publication arm of Lokapal, dedicated to exploring decentralized governance (DeGov), DAO structures, and the philosophical and systemic foundations of decentralization. Through rigorous analysis and interdisciplinary insights, DAO Horizons aims to bridge theory and practice in the evolving world of DAOs.

## Our Focus
DAO Horizons leans heavily into system theory and philosophy to examine how decentralized governance can be effectively structured, sustained, and evolved. Our research delves into:
- Governance models and their systemic implications.
- The philosophical underpinnings of decentralization and autonomy.
- Emerging trends and innovations in DAO mechanisms.
- Practical case studies on successful and failed DAOs.
